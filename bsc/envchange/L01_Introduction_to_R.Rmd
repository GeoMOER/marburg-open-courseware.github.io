```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R as a calculator
R can be used as a simple calculator. Standard syntax is valid.

```{r calculator}
1 + 1
5^2
sqrt(25)
```

## Object definition
To define objects in R we use `<-` to assign a value (or anything really) to a named object.

```{r objects}
one <- 2
one + one
one + 1

mytext <- c("I", "am", "hungry")
mytext
```

## Getting help
To access R's built-in help pages use `help(<functionName>)` or simply `?`

```{r help}
?c
```

## Working directory
To set the working directory (i.e. the folder on the disk where R is pointing to) use `setwd()`

```{r wd}
getwd()
setwd("/home/ede/tappelhans/uni/marburg/lehre/2016/ss/PS_global_change")
```


## Object types
**First rule of R:** *Everything is possible*  
**Second rule of R:** *Everything is a vector*

### vectors

```{r numeric}
class(1)
class(c(1, one))
class(c(1, one, mytext))
c(1, one, mytext)
```

### matrices

```{r matrix}
class(1)
class(one)
```
